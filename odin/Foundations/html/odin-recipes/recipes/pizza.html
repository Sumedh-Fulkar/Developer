  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Pizza is an Italian dish consisting of a typically round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with ingredients like tomatoes, cheese, and various other additions, then baked. Originating in Naples, Italy, the modern pizza has evolved from simple flatbreads consumed by the poor into a global phenomenon with countless regional variations.</p>
